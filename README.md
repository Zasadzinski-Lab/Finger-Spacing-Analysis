# Surfactant Wavelength Analysis

This repository contains resources and analysis focused on surfactant-driven phenomena, including fingering instabilities. It features visualizations and a Jupyter Notebook for surfactant wavelength analysis.

## Project Overview

The **Surfactant Wavelength Analysis** project analyzes fingering instabilities. The provided visualization captures the onset of fingering patterns, and the notebook performs wavelength analysis using experimental data.

### Key Files:
1. **`Fingering Onset.gif`**  
   - A visualization depicting the development of fingering instabilities at the onset stage.
   - This can be used for qualitative analysis of pattern formation.

2. **`Surfactant_Wavelength_Analysis.ipynb`**  
   - A Jupyter Notebook analyzing the wavelength of patterns in surfactant fingering instabilities.
   - Includes:
     - Data pre-processing  
     - Wavelength computation methods  
     - Visualizations and pattern recognition  
     - Summary statistics

- Python 3.8+
- Jupyter Notebook
- Numpy
- Matplotlib
- Pandas
- OpenCV or Scipy (if advanced image analysis is needed)

Install dependencies via pip:

```bash
pip install numpy matplotlib pandas jupyterlab
```
